Both scripts include a detailed description of their functionality,
extensive commentary, and a helper guide, that describes which parameters the script accepts,
both obligatory and optional ones, and how they can be defined. 

The guide can be accessed through the terminal using the -h parameter
after the script's name. 

For example, type ./create_p2sh_address.py -h
